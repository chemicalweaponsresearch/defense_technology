> "This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. ... We must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the militaryâ€“industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists, and will persist." - @Eisenhower

At the center of it all, we have the United States Army a century ago to thank for Defense Technology today.
Indeed, the contemporary chemical weapons industry is a type example of how the power given to and taken by the Military Industrial Complex creates persistent threats to the civilian way of life.

<br> 

Born out of the War Department during the first World War [@Addison1919], the United States [Chemical Warfare Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_Corps) (CWS; since renamed the [Chemical Corps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_Corps)) ignited the industry and continues to dictate the narrative on chemical weapons use to this day.

<br> 

The first such regiment of the [American Expeditionary Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Expeditionary_Forces) (the US Army formation on the [Western Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Front_(World_War_I))) was established as the [30th Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2nd_Chemical_Battalion_(United_States)) (later the 1st Gas Unit and then the 2nd Chemical Battalion
under the command of Colonel [Amos Fries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Fries) [@AEF_31].
Fries would come to be a major player in the establishment of a domestic chemical weapons industry targeted specifically at organized labor, Indigenous peoples, and his political enemies ("The Communists").

The unit's slogan remains to this day "Flammis Vincimus", Latin for "We Conquer with Fire", a explicit reference to their use of _offensive_ chemical weapons in WWI [@Langer1965; @USArmy2019].


## Predecession {-}

### The Bureau of Mines {-}

The CWS did not spontaneously form out of the mustard gas clouds of the Western Front, but was the result of a concerted effort to establish a domestic chemical weapons program in response to the obvious use of chemical warfare by European powers prior to the US entering WWI [@Gross2015].

Following the observations US Army Assistant Surgeon [James R. Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Robb_Church) made on trips to France in 1916 and 1917, [President Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson) requested assistance from federal agencies to support the [War Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_War) in developing defensive and offensive gas capabilities [@Gross2015].

A major contributor was the [Department of Interior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Interior)'s [Bureau of Mines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bureau_of_Mines), which had practical research experience in keeping miners safe from toxic gases [@Brophy1956; @Gross2015].
The Bureau, led by Van Manning, had enthusiastically responded to Wilson's request, so when the US Congress declared war on Germany in April 1917, they were immediately put in charge of chemical weapons defense [@NYTimes1932; @Gross2015].

### The National Academy of Sciences' Committee on Gases in Warfare {-}

President Wilson requested that the [National Academy of Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Academy_of_Sciences) (NAS) establish a [National Research Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Academies_of_Sciences,_Engineering,_and_Medicine#Program_units) (NRC) with broad scope to increase the use of science in industry, but specifically targeted at "strengthening national defense" and promoting "national security" [@Cochrane1978].
Upon the US entering the war, the NRC created a Committee on Noxious Gases (quickly renamed the Committee on Gases used in Warfare) headed by Manning, who would later recommend the formation of the CWS [@NYTimes1932; @Brophy1956; @Russell1996].
Manning appointed the Bureau of Mines' George Burrell as the Committee's research director and Burrell immediately took to developing gas masks [@VilenskyandSinish2005a; @VilenskyandSinish2005b].

### Camp American University {-}

The Bureau was quickly overwhelmed with work, however, and by May of 1917 was authorized to collaborate with chemists at universities, in private industry, and from other federal agencies, sowing the seeds that blossomed into the "peacetime" Chemical Weapons Industrial Complex of today [@VilenskyandSinish2005a; @VilenskyandSinish2005b] 
In July, a central research laboratory was established at [American University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_University) in Washington, D.C. (The Army's "[Camp American University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_American_University)") as the "Experimental Station", and got to work developing offensive gas capabilities as well defensive tools [@Brophy1956; @VilenskyandSinish2005b].

The footprint of Camp American University persists to this day, a century after the war.
Reportedly $800,000 (in 1918, translating to roughly $14,000,000 in 2021) worth of weapons were buried in a pit referred to as "Death Valley" [@Albright2011; @Ashooh2015].
These stockpiles continue to be unearthed from campus and adjoining properties, making news as recently as the 2010s [@Ashooh2015].

### Pershing Calls for Gas Force {-}

The [American Expeditionary Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Expeditionary_Forces), stationed along the Western Front, were under the command of Gen. John J. Pershing [@Pershing1931_1; @Pershing1931_2].

On July 5th, 1917, General Pershing ordered the creation of a Gas Service Section complement [@Edgecomb2001].
Expanding on this order, on August 15th, the War Department authorized and established an offensive gas force designated as the 30th Engineer Regiment, nicknamed Gas and Flame [@WarDept_108].
The Regiment was officially activated on September 2nd under the command of Army Engineer Col. [Amos Fries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Fries) [@AEF_31; @Addison1919].

A companion Chemical Service Section was established by the War Department in October and November of 1917 [@Harris1921].


## Formation {-}

Under General Order 62 from the War Department, issued June 28th 1918, the Gas and Chemical Service Sections were joined to create the [Chemical Warfare Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_Corps) [@Harris1921; @Edgecomb2001; @Witte2001].
Immediately, President Wilson transferred the American University Experimental Station from the Bureau of Mines to the CWS [@VilenskyandSinish2005b], providing the Army with its own proper chemical weapons research hub.

Following the formation of the CWS, the 30th Engineer Regiment was re-designated as the 1st Gas Regiment [@Addison1919; @USArmy2019].

### Major General Sibert, Imperialist Engineer {-}

The first head of the Chemical Warfare Service was Major General [William Sibert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_L._Sibert), a distinguished army engineer that had previously served as Chief Engineer of the Manila and Dagupan Railroad during the US occupation of the Philippine Islands and was a member of the Panama Canal Commission responsible for critical construction projects [@Dickey2015].
Despite his rank Sibert was not so much a combat commander, but rather a top-level project manager.

He put these skills to work and by January of 1919, the CWS's main production arsenal in Edgewood, MD was generating 3,000,000 pounds of [chloropicrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloropicrin) -- a particularly noxious fumigant made by the Army as a chemical weapon [@Ayres1919] -- per month [@Russell1996].
One chemical weapon of developed by the CWS during this time was [Lewisite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewisite), an organoarsenic compound used as a blister agent and lung irritant. 
So successful was Sibert's CWS at production of Lewisite that it consumed nearly 1/3 of the country's arsenic supply, causing problems for the insecticide industry that uses arsenic-based compounds to treat agricultural crops [@Russell1996].

#### First Contact {-}

In August of 1919, A. D. Porter of the New York Police Department sent a letter to Sibert requesting his opinion on the use of chemical weapons to disperse "crowds of strikers and disorderly persons", the first of many fielded by the CWS in the wake of the war [@Jones1978].
Workers movements, 
In Porter's view, "gases might be an efficient agency in suppressing disorder", but he was not sure if "there would likely be any serious or lasting results to the people gased, and whether ... public opinion would tolerate" its use [@Jones1978].

Sibert replied that tear gas (primarily CN at the time) would a good method to disperse crowds away from the battlefield and noted that the CWS was already developing special grenades for this type of "police work" in American territories like the Philippines and in Central America [@Jones1978].

The service was unable to finalize the grenade design before the head of the War Department explicitly forbade all military branches from deploying chemical materials in civil disturbances (or conveying them to local agencies to use on their own) in a confidential memo on November 7th of 1919 [@Jones1978].


### Major General Fries, Chemical Weapons Zealot {-}

Sibert led the CWS from 1918 until he retired in April 1920, when he passed control to Major General [Amos Fries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Fries).
Fries had been in charge of the Gas Service Section during the war, and thus hand first-hand experience with deployment and consequences of chemical warfare [@Addison1919].

Fries led the Chemical Warfare Service through the 1920s, establishing the unit as necessary even in peacetime, despite the efforts of the rest of the Army brass to disband it following the 6-month post-war timetable outlined in the General Order creating it [@Harris1921; @Edgecomb2001; @Witte2001].

To do this, he had to take a decidely more vocal stance against the War Department's restriction, which was still in place.
Fries openly disagreed with the policy in Congressional testimony and in his replies to the now regular requests for weapons from law enforcement agencies around the country [@Jones1978].
However, it appears that through the remainder of the Wilson Administration, the War Department only added restrictions to the CWS -- eliminating training activies and demonstrations with live chemical munitions [@Jones1978].

#### Opening the Floodgates and then Closing Them and then Opening Them and then ... {-}

The policies of the War Department on chemical weapons shifted qualitatively when [Warren Harding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_G._Harding) was sworn in to the Presidency and began filling his cabinet in 1921.
John J. Pershing, with all his first-hand experience with and love of chemical warfare, became chief of staff July 1st [@Jones1978].
Later that month, on July 19th in Philadelphia, the CWS conducted its first demonstration for a local police department [@NYTimes1921_07_20; @McGarry1921].
Afterwards, Philly PD adopted tear gas as a tactic [@Jones1978].
A similar show occurred in New York city three days later [@NYTimes1921_07_23].

The prohibition on use of chemical weapons by federal troops against civilians was briefly rescinded in September of 1921 when Pershing called Fries for assistance in control a coal miners strike in West Virginia [@Jones1978].
The massive show of chemical weapons being transferred to the site of the strike, including bombs to be dropped from planes, drew national attention [@BaltimoreSun1921] and had the chilling effect of stopping the strike without needing to be deployed [@Jones1978].

The ban was reinstated on January 8th of 1922, although Pershing supported Fries' interpretation that the current version allowed internal distribution within the armed forces [@Jones1978].
The CWS gave demonstrations on how to use the chemical weapons to National Guard battalions over the spring and summer, as well [@Jones1978].

The Guard corps were (temporarily) authorized to use chemical weapons against striking railroad workers on July 21st and just generally in territories (Hawaii, Panama Canal Zone, the Philippines) on August 14th [@Jones1978].

Early the next year (February 12th), the CWS was finally allowed to sell chemical weapons to the National Guard, albeit only for use in training purposes [@Jones1978].

By that point, however, the domestic market had already whetted its appetite and a new private industry was starting to take orders for the National Guard and police forces alike.

And of particular relevance for our story here, rather than lose out to the private companies, the CWS was actually central in the privatization of the chemical weapons industrial complex and its expansion of use to "everday" controlling of political enemies [@Feigenbaum2014].
