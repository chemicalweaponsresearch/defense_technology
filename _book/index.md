> This litigation involves two entities with confusingly similar names. The first is defendant Defense Technology Corporation of America ("DTC"), a Delaware corporation. It is a subsidiary of Armor Holdings, Inc., and does business in Casper, Wyoming. The second company is Defense Technology Corporation of America of Casper, Wyoming, ("DTC-Wyoming"), a Wyoming corporation. In 1996, DTC-Wyoming sold its assets to DTC. - [Hon. J.
