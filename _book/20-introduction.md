[Defense Technology](https://www.defense-technology.com/) is the predominate manufacturer of [chemical munitions](/munitions_library) we have recovered in Portland since May 2020 and their weapons are used by law enforcement agencies around the world.


Over the course of my work studying the environmental and human impacts of Defense Technology's weapons, I became interested in understanding what this company was all about, where they came from, and who was profiting off of it.
I started digging into their corporate structure and history, which turns out, is extensive and old, with tendrils reaching through Big Names in the weapons industry like the American classic [Smith and Wesson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_%26_Wesson) and the British multinational [BAE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAE_Systems) all the way back to the United States Army's Chemical Warfare Service.

This book is my attempt to wrestle this complex, confusing history into something understandable.

Buckle up, it's about to get wild.
