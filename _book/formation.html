<h2>Formation</h2>
<p>Under General Order 62 from the War Department, issued June 28th 1918, the Gas and Chemical Service Sections were joined to create the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_Corps">Chemical Warfare Service</a> <span class="citation">(Harris <a href="References.html#ref-Harris1921" role="doc-biblioref">1921</a>; Edgecomb <a href="References.html#ref-Edgecomb2001" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>; Witte <a href="References.html#ref-Witte2001" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>)</span>.
Immediately, President Wilson transferred the American University Experimental Station from the Bureau of Mines to the CWS <span class="citation">(Vilensky and Sinish <a href="References.html#ref-VilenskyandSinish2005b" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a><a href="References.html#ref-VilenskyandSinish2005b" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span>, providing the Army with its own proper chemical weapons research hub.</p>
<p>Following the formation of the CWS, the 30th Engineer Regiment was re-designated as the 1st Gas Regiment <span class="citation">(Addison <a href="References.html#ref-Addison1919" role="doc-biblioref">1919</a>; Bowery <a href="References.html#ref-USArmy2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>.</p>
<div id="major-general-sibert-imperialist-engineer" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Major General Sibert, Imperialist Engineer</h3>
<p>The first head of the Chemical Warfare Service was Major General <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_L._Sibert">William Sibert</a>, a distinguished army engineer that had previously served as Chief Engineer of the Manila and Dagupan Railroad during the US occupation of the Philippine Islands and was a member of the Panama Canal Commission responsible for critical construction projects <span class="citation">(Dickey <a href="References.html#ref-Dickey2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>.
Despite his rank Sibert was not so much a combat commander, but rather a top-level project manager.</p>
<p>He put these skills to work and by January of 1919, the CWS’s main production arsenal in Edgewood, MD was generating 3,000,000 pounds of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloropicrin">chloropicrin</a> – a particularly noxious fumigant made by the Army as a chemical weapon <span class="citation">(Ayres <a href="References.html#ref-Ayres1919" role="doc-biblioref">1919</a>)</span> – per month <span class="citation">(Russell <a href="References.html#ref-Russell1996" role="doc-biblioref">1996</a>)</span>.
One chemical weapon of developed by the CWS during this time was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewisite">Lewisite</a>, an organoarsenic compound used as a blister agent and lung irritant.
So successful was Sibert’s CWS at production of Lewisite that it consumed nearly 1/3 of the country’s arsenic supply, causing problems for the insecticide industry that uses arsenic-based compounds to treat agricultural crops <span class="citation">(Russell <a href="References.html#ref-Russell1996" role="doc-biblioref">1996</a>)</span>.</p>
<div id="first-contact" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>First Contact</h4>
<p>In August of 1919, A. D. Porter of the New York Police Department sent a letter to Sibert requesting his opinion on the use of chemical weapons to disperse “crowds of strikers and disorderly persons”, the first of many fielded by the CWS in the wake of the war <span class="citation">(Jones <a href="References.html#ref-Jones1978" role="doc-biblioref">1978</a>)</span>.
Workers movements,
In Porter’s view, “gases might be an efficient agency in suppressing disorder”, but he was not sure if “there would likely be any serious or lasting results to the people gased, and whether … public opinion would tolerate” its use <span class="citation">(Jones <a href="References.html#ref-Jones1978" role="doc-biblioref">1978</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Sibert replied that tear gas (primarily CN at the time) would a good method to disperse crowds away from the battlefield and noted that the CWS was already developing special grenades for this type of “police work” in American territories like the Philippines and in Central America <span class="citation">(Jones <a href="References.html#ref-Jones1978" role="doc-biblioref">1978</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The service was unable to finalize the grenade design before the head of the War Department explicitly forbade all military branches from deploying chemical materials in civil disturbances (or conveying them to local agencies to use on their own) in a confidential memo on November 7th of 1919 <span class="citation">(Jones <a href="References.html#ref-Jones1978" role="doc-biblioref">1978</a>)</span>.</p>

<div id="major-general-fries-chemical-weapons-zealot" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Major General Fries, Chemical Weapons Zealot</h3>
<p>Sibert led the CWS from 1918 until he retired in April 1920, when he passed control to Major General <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Fries">Amos Fries</a>.
Fries had been in charge of the Gas Service Section during the war, and thus hand first-hand experience with deployment and consequences of chemical warfare <span class="citation">(Addison <a href="References.html#ref-Addison1919" role="doc-biblioref">1919</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Fries led the Chemical Warfare Service through the 1920s, establishing the unit as necessary even in peacetime, despite the efforts of the rest of the Army brass to disband it following the 6-month post-war timetable outlined in the General Order creating it <span class="citation">(Harris <a href="References.html#ref-Harris1921" role="doc-biblioref">1921</a>; Edgecomb <a href="References.html#ref-Edgecomb2001" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>; Witte <a href="References.html#ref-Witte2001" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>To do this, he had to take a decidely more vocal stance against the War Department’s restriction, which was still in place.
Fries openly disagreed with the policy in Congressional testimony and in his replies to the now regular requests for weapons from law enforcement agencies around the country <span class="citation">(Jones <a href="References.html#ref-Jones1978" role="doc-biblioref">1978</a>)</span>.
However, it appears that through the remainder of the Wilson Administration, the War Department only added restrictions to the CWS – eliminating training activies and demonstrations with live chemical munitions <span class="citation">(Jones <a href="References.html#ref-Jones1978" role="doc-biblioref">1978</a>)</span>.</p>
<div id="opening-the-floodgates-and-then-closing-them-and-then-opening-them-and-then" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Opening the Floodgates and then Closing Them and then Opening Them and then …</h4>
<p>The policies of the War Department on chemical weapons shifted qualitatively when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_G._Harding">Warren Harding</a> was sworn in to the Presidency and began filling his cabinet in 1921.
John J. Pershing, with all his first-hand experience with and love of chemical warfare, became chief of staff July 1st <span class="citation">(Jones <a href="References.html#ref-Jones1978" role="doc-biblioref">1978</a>)</span>.
Later that month, on July 19th in Philadelphia, the CWS conducted its first demonstration for a local police department <span class="citation">(New York Times <a href="References.html#ref-NYTimes1921_07_20" role="doc-biblioref">1921</a><a href="References.html#ref-NYTimes1921_07_20" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>; McGarry <a href="References.html#ref-McGarry1921" role="doc-biblioref">1921</a>)</span>.
Afterwards, Philly PD adopted tear gas as a tactic <span class="citation">(Jones <a href="References.html#ref-Jones1978" role="doc-biblioref">1978</a>)</span>.
A similar show occurred in New York city three days later <span class="citation">(New York Times <a href="References.html#ref-NYTimes1921_07_23" role="doc-biblioref">1921</a><a href="References.html#ref-NYTimes1921_07_23" role="doc-biblioref">b</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The prohibition on use of chemical weapons by federal troops against civilians was briefly rescinded in September of 1921 when Pershing called Fries for assistance in control a coal miners strike in West Virginia <span class="citation">(Jones <a href="References.html#ref-Jones1978" role="doc-biblioref">1978</a>)</span>.
The massive show of chemical weapons being transferred to the site of the strike, including bombs to be dropped from planes, drew national attention <span class="citation">(Baltimore Sun <a href="References.html#ref-BaltimoreSun1921" role="doc-biblioref">1921</a>)</span> and had the chilling effect of stopping the strike without needing to be deployed <span class="citation">(Jones <a href="References.html#ref-Jones1978" role="doc-biblioref">1978</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The ban was reinstated on January 8th of 1922, although Pershing supported Fries’ interpretation that the current version allowed internal distribution within the armed forces <span class="citation">(Jones <a href="References.html#ref-Jones1978" role="doc-biblioref">1978</a>)</span>.
The CWS gave demonstrations on how to use the chemical weapons to National Guard battalions over the spring and summer, as well <span class="citation">(Jones <a href="References.html#ref-Jones1978" role="doc-biblioref">1978</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The Guard corps were (temporarily) authorized to use chemical weapons against striking railroad workers on July 21st and just generally in territories (Hawaii, Panama Canal Zone, the Philippines) on August 14th <span class="citation">(Jones <a href="References.html#ref-Jones1978" role="doc-biblioref">1978</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Early the next year (February 12th), the CWS was finally allowed to sell chemical weapons to the National Guard, albeit only for use in training purposes <span class="citation">(Jones <a href="References.html#ref-Jones1978" role="doc-biblioref">1978</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>By that point, however, the domestic market had already whetted its appetite and a new private industry was starting to take orders for the National Guard and police forces alike.</p>
<p>And of particular relevance for our story here, rather than lose out to the private companies, the CWS was actually central in the privatization of the chemical weapons industrial complex and its expansion of use to “everday” controlling of political enemies <span class="citation">(Feigenbaum <a href="References.html#ref-Feigenbaum2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>.</p>
